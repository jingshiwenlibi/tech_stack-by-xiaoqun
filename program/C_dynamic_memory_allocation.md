C dynamic memory allocation refers to performing manual memory management for dynamic memory allocation in the C programming language via a group of functions in the C standard library, namely 
* malloc, -- allocates the specified number of bytes
* realloc, 
* calloc -- allocates the specified number of bytes and initializes them to zero
* and free.<br/>

In C++, operators __new__ and __delete__ are recommended by the language's authors.br/
<br/>
The C programming language manages memory
* statically, -- allocated in main memory
* automatically, -- allocated on the stack
* or dynamically -- from the free store, called __heap__ <br/>
