## JavaScript HTML DOM
With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.<br/>
### The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.<br/>
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:<br/>
* The HTML DOM Tree of Objects<br/>

* JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
* JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
* JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
* JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
* JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
### What is the HTML DOM?
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:<br/>
* The HTML elements as objects
* The properties of all HTML elements
* The methods to access all HTML elements
* The events for all HTML elements

In other words: **The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.**
