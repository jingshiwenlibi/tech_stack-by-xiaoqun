### Security: Security groups and ACLs
Amazon VPC provides features that you can use to increase and monitor the security for your VPC:

* Security groups — Act as a __firewall__ for associated Amazon __EC2 instances__, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level
* Network access control lists (ACLs) — Act as a __firewall__ for associated __subnets__, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level
* Flow logs — Capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC
