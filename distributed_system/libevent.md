# Linux libevent Introduction

The __libevent__ API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on __a file descriptor__ or after __a timeout__ has been reached. Furthermore, __libevent__ also support callbacks due to __signals or regular timeouts__.

__libevent__ is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs to call __event_dispatch()__ and then __add or remove events dynamically__ without having to change the event loop.
